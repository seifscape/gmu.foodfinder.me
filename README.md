What The Fuck Should I Eat: GMU
========================

A web app, API, and mobile app to help you find food at George Mason University at any hour.

Uses:
- WTF Engine: https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine
- Ruby on Rails
- Twitter Bootstrap?

@TODO:
- Use GPS information from mobile app users to show them on a Google Map distance to the food spots and walking directions (if available and useful)
- Use Twitter Bootstrap to make this thing look nice and sexy?
- Create a WTF Engine gem at the end of this project?
- Figure out if should use Recurring for holidays and such? https://github.com/ggoodale/recurring/blob/master/lib/schedule.rb
- buy: http://whatthefuckshouldieatatgmu.com/
- Get Google Analytics working then deploy to Heroku
